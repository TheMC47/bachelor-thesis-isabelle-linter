First of all, I want to thank Prof. Tobias Nipkow for allowing me to do the thesis at his chair.
I would like as well to thank both my supervisors, Fabian Huch and Lukas Stevens, for
helping me throughout this thesis. From the discussions before starting the thesis to their
last remarks before the submission, they were extremely helpful, patient, and open to discuss
whatever ideas and suggestions I had.

Moreover, I am thankful to my family, my parents Mourad and Basma, and my siblings, Zeineb
and Mohammed, since without them, nothing I achieved would have been possible. I also want
to thank my extended family for their encouragement and support, especially my Grandparents Mohammed and
Saloua, and Mohammed and Mouna, for flooding me with prayers and good wishes whenever I was blessed to see them. Special thanks are also due to my aunt Mouna for proof-reading my thesis.

Finally, I would like to thank Ons for her constant love and support and for also
being patient while listening to me enthusiastically explain the details of the thesis.
