While the interactive theorem prover Isabelle can assist with developing intricate formalizations 
leveraging the power of
interactive proofs, not all of them have the same quality. Indeed, some proofs might require a
higher maintenance effort or be harder to read and understand. 
Some of the patterns causing these unwieldy formalizations are identified through the years
by the Isabelle community. A prominent resource demonstrating these patterns and how to avoid 
them is 
\textit{Gerwin Klein's Style Guide for Isabelle/HOL}. However, as it stands, there is no
existing tool to automatically warn users of these pitfalls or suggest better alternatives.
We attempt to fill this gap in the Isabelle environment by developing an Isabelle 
\textit{linter}. The 
linter offers basic configurability, extensibility, Isabelle/jEdit integration, and a
standalone command-line tool. With the help of the 20 implemented checks, it uncovered 252 
problems in \textit{Isabelle/HOL}, \SI{28.97}{\percent} of which are of high severity, \SI{58.35}{\percent} of medium severity, and \SI{14.68}{\percent} of low severity.
Adding to that, 20 randomly-selected entries from \textit{the Archive of Formal Proofs} are analyzed,
which produced 575 lints distributed as follows: \SI{45.39}{\percent} of high severity, \SI{44.17}{\percent}
 of medium severity,
and \SI{10.43}{\percent} of low severity.
